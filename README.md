# react-native
Spent the day reading documentation on Next 13.  I know I want my next project to mainly focus on managing multiple users.   I'm torn between building with Next.js 13 or React native but I'm leaning towards making some sort of messaging app.  My friends always make fun of me for not having the Iphone  message bubble in our group chat.
